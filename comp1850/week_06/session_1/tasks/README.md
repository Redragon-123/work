# Week 6, Session 1: Tasks

Task 1 involves creating a Markdown file `tests.md` containing a table with
details of the values needed to test the `comfort_level()` function provided
for you in `weather.py`.

Task 2 involves completing the implementation of some unit tests for
`comfort_level()`. Edit the file `test_comfort.py` and make the changes
suggested by the comments.

Task 3 involves installing a testing tool, [pytest](https://pytest.org), and
then using it to run the tests implemented for Task 2.

See the slides for further details.

After completing these tasks, the remainder of your time should be spent on
the mini-project.
