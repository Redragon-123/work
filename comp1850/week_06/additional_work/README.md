# Additional Work For Week 6

If you finish the tasks and mini-project quickly and have time on your hands,
here are some suggestions for other work you can do.

* Read the pytest documentation. Learn about how to test that code throws
  exceptions when expected to do so.

* Research the concept of **test fixtures**. Investigate how pytest supports
  their creation.

* Another Python testing tool is [tox](https://tox.wiki/). Research this
  tool to understand how it can be used in testing Python projects.

* In class, we demonstrated one way of creating virtual environments and
  installing Python packages into them. Other tools exist for doing this,
  one of the newer ones being [uv](https://astral.sh/).

  Read the docs for uv to learn how it works. Then use it to create a small
  Python project, with unit tests. Use pytest to handle testing within the
  project.
