# Week 6, Session 2: Tasks

Continue implementing your mini-project.

Make sure that all contributors have completed their functions and that
all unit tests pass.

Merge the work of contributors from each of their branches into the main
branch. Make any further changes or additions that are needed in order
for your application to work properly.
