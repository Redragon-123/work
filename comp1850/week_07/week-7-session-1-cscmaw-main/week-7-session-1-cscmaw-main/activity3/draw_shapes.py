# write code to import the shapes module


# write code to create an instance of Circle and then a call the draw method


# write code to create an instance of Rectangle and then a call to the draw method


# write code to create an instance of Square and then a call to the draw method


# write code to create an instance of Triangle and then a call to the draw method






# Notice how you have to use shapes.Circle, shapes.Rectangle, shapes.Square, etc...
# when you create instances of different classes from the shape module? Wouldn't
# it be nice if you don't need to do it that way and simply use Circle, Rectangle, etc...?

# The answer is yes, we can do that with "from ... import". In this example
# we can put "from shapes import Circle, Rectangle, Square, Triangle"
# and then proceed to use Circle, Rectangle, etc... when creating instances of those
# classes. 

# You can now update your code to reflect on this change.
import shapes
from shapes import Circle, Rectangle, Square, Triangle
circle = Circle()
circle.draw()
rectangle = Rectangle()
rectangle.draw()
square = Square()
square.draw()
triangle = Triangle()
triangle.draw()
