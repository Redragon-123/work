# define a Circle class that inherits from Shape class.
# this class has the following field and methods:
# (1) radius
# (2) __init__(self, radius) - initialise the radius and update the value of shape to "circle"
# (3) area(self) - returns the area of a circle based on the radius
#     area = math.pi * radius * radius





# define a Rectangle class that inherits from Shape class.
# this class has the following fields and methods:
# (1) width
# (2) height
# (3) __init__(self, width, height) - initialise width and height and update the value of shape to "rectangle"
# (4) area(self) - returns the area of a rectangle
#     area = width * height




# once done, create an instance of Circle and Rectangle and 
# print the area for both instances
