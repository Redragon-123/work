# write code to import document


# define a class WordDocument that inherits from the Document class with the following field:
# (1) word_count - the number of words in the Word document



# this class has the following methods:
# (1) spell_check() - prints a message indicating that spell-check is running on the document
#     e.g., Running spell check...  Note: no, you are not actually writing code to run spell checking
# (2) __str__ - override the __str__ method to include word count in the description
#     e.g., 
#     Document: Project Proposal
#     Title: Project Proposal by Jane Smith, created on 2023-05-20
#     WordDocument: 2500 words
