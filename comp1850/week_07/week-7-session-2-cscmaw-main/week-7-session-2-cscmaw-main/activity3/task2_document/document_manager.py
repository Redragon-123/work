# write code to import all required documents



# define a class DocumentManager with the following field:
# (1) documents - a list to store multiple Document objects




# this class has the following methods:
# (1) add_document(document) - adds a document to the collection, i.e., the documents field
# (2) list_documents() - prints a summary of each document in the collection
#     e.g.,
#     Documents in the manager:
#      - PDFDocument: Monthly Report, 10 pages
#      - WordDocument: Project Proposal, 2500 words
#      - Spreadsheet: Budget Plan, 3 sheets
# (3) remove_document(title) - removes a document from the list based on its title. If the document
#     is not found, displays a message e.g., Monthly Report is not found




# Once done, 
# (1) write code to create an instance of DocumentManager
# (2) write code to create an instance of other type of documents
# (3) write code to call add_document, list_documents, remove_document, and then list_documents
