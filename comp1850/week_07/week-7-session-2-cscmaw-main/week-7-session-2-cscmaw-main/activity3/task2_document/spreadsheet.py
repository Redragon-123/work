# write code to import document



# define a Spreadsheet class that inherits from the Document class with the following field:
# (1) num_sheets - the number of sheets in the spreadsheet



# this child class has the following methods:
# (1) calculate_totals() - prints a message indicating that calculations are being performed on the spreadsheet
#     e.g., Calculating totals...   Note: no, you are not actually writing code to perform the calculations
# (2) __str__ - override the __str__ method to include the number of sheets in the description
#     e.g., 
#     Document: Budget Plan
#     Title: Budget Plan by Alan Brown, created on 2023-01-15
#     Spreadsheet: 3 sheets
