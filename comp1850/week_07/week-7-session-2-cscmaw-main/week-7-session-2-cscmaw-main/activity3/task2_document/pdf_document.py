# write code to import document


# define a PDFDocument class that inherits from Document class with the following fields:
# (1) page_count - the number of pages in the PDF



# this class has the following methods:
# (1) render_pdf() - prints a message indicating that the PDF is being rendered (e.g., Rendering PDF...)
#     Note: no, you are not actually writing code to render the PDF
# (2) __str__ - override the __str__ method to also include page count in the description
#     e.g.,
#     Document: Monthly Report
#     Title: Monthly Report by John Doe, created on 2023-08-01
#     PDFDocument: 10 pages
