# define a WeatherDataset class that represents a sequence of WeatherRecord instances


# this class has the following fields:
# (1) weather_records - a list of WeatherRecord instances


# this class has the following methods:
# (1) __init__(self, filename) - to initialise the weather_records
#     with data from filename, example file is leeds.csv - make sure to look inside leeds.csv
# (2) size() - returns the number of weather records
# (3) add_record(record) - adds a WeatherRecord instance
# (4) max_wind_speed() - returns a WeatherRecord instance with the highest wind speed
# (5) max_temperature() - retuns a WeatherRecord instance with the highest temperature
# (6) min_humidity - returns a WeatherRecord instance with the lowest humidity






# once completed, create an instance of WeatherDataset and 
# (1) print the number of weather records in the WeatherDataset instance
# (2) print the weather record with the highest wind speed
# (3) print the weather record with the highest temperature
# (4) print the weather record with the lowest humidty
